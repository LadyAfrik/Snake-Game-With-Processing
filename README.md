# Snake Game (Mouse-Controlled)

## **About the Game**
This is a simple snake game built using **Processing**. The game is controlled using the **mouse**. The player directs the snake by clicking in the direction they want it to move. The goal is to eat as much food as possible while avoiding collisions with the walls and itself.

## **How to Play**
1. **Start the Game:**  
   - The game begins automatically when you run it in Processing.
   - The snake starts moving in a default direction.

2. **Control the Snake:**  
   - Click anywhere on the screen to change the snakeâ€™s direction.
   - The snake moves towards the click based on the **horizontal or vertical** distance.

3. **Eating Food:**  
   - The snake "eats" the food when its head touches it.
   - Each time the snake eats, it grows longer, and your score increases.
   - The food respawns at a new random location.

4. **Game Over Conditions:**  
   - The game ends if the snake **hits the wall**.
   - The game also ends if the snake **collides with itself**.

5. **Restarting the Game:**  
   - If the game ends, restart by clicking the **Run** button again in Processing.
